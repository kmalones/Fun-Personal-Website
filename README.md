# Fun-Personal-Website


This folder contains the source files for a simple personal/home page used for INST377 assignment work.

## What’s in this folder

- `home.html` — The main page for the assignment (view this in a browser).
- `home.css` — Stylesheet for the page (updated to a modern, responsive design).
- `contact_page.html`, `contact.css` — Contact page assets.
- `games.html`, `games.css` — Example pages used in the assignment.
- `success_form_page.html` — A success page shown after form submission.

## How to view locally

Option 1 — Open the HTML file directly in your browser:

- Double-click `home.html` or right-click and choose "Open With → Browser".

Option 2 — Run a tiny local HTTP server (recommended for consistent behavior):

If you have Python 3 installed, run from the `Assignment 1` directory:

```bash
# macOS / zsh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/home.html` in your browser.
